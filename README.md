Is Fenbendazole Really Effective in Anticancer？

Not long ago, I received news that a patient with advanced cancer in the United States had been treated with fenbendazole.

Therefore, in China, some families with cancer or cancer also adopt this program to treat them.

But I'm confused.

Is the scheme effective and is the event real?

It seems that the proponents of the scheme have not benefited at all.

Can I try this program to treat cancer?

芬苯达唑真的有效抗癌吗？              
不久前，我收到消息，美国一位晚期癌症患者接受了芬苯达唑治疗。             
因此，在中国，一些有癌症或癌症的家庭也采用这个方案来治疗他们。              
但我很困惑。              
方案是否有效，事件是否真实？              
这项计划的支持者似乎根本没有从中受益。              
我能试试这个治疗癌症的程序吗？
