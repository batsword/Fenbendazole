# Fenbendazole
Is Fenbendazole Really Effective in Anticancer？

Not long ago, I received news that a patient with advanced cancer in the United States had been treated with fenbendazole.

Therefore, in China, some families with cancer or cancer also adopt this program to treat them.

But I'm confused.

Is the scheme effective and is the event real?

It seems that the proponents of the scheme have not benefited at all.

Can I try this program to treat cancer?
